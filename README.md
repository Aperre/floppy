Floppy
=====================
#### The mod that makes your fish flop their way to the water.
This is a pretty simple mod. It adds velocity on each flop that brings it to the closest 
water source. It does not change the behavior of other fish like mobs (eg. Guardians).
It should be compatible with all most mods. If not please inform me in the [issues](https://github.com/Aperre/floppy/issues).
It will also work with all mobs that use the `AbstractFish` class.
